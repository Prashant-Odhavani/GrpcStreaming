# gRPC Streaming with .NET

This project demonstrates the core concepts of **gRPC** in .NET, showcasing different service types and streaming mechanisms through real-world examples.

## Features

- **Unary Call**: One request → One response.
- **Server Streaming**: One request → Stream of responses.
- **Client Streaming**: Stream of requests → One response.
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Stream of requests ↔ Stream of responses.

Each example is implemented with meaningful use cases, such as fetching user information, sending notifications, uploading activities, and real-time chat.
